#Pawfect Oasis

##Demo
##Overview
Pawfect Oasis is a cosy and eco-friendly hotel for pets with 4 cabins, providing a home-from-home to your furry companions.

- They first need an internal app to manage bookings, cabins and guests.
- They need an API.
- Later they will need a website where customers can book stays.

##Tech Stack
Setting up a React project using Vite. Unlike CRA, Vite requires config (e.g ESLint, Prettier).

- Using ESLint is by far the easiest way to reduce bugs (aka problematic code). It's also configureable.
- Prettier is not difficult to setup, and it keeps my sanity.

Supabase is an efficient option for backend (Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Storage) with Postgres database.

styled-components enables writing CSS in JS. This means all the features of CSS including media queries, all pseudo-selectors, nesting, etc are accessible. I could have used ChakraUI or Tailwind but itâ€™s good to practice writing more CSS.

Context API and Hooks for local state management.

React Query for server (remote) state management now that I store data in Supabase. A few benefits of React Query: automatic loading and error states, data being cached, automatic re-fetching to keep state synced.

React Router for SPA navigation

React Hook Form to handle big forms more easily

Others: date-fns, Recharts, React icons, React hot toast
